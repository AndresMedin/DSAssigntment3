Replit
  Please read this part if you do NOT know how to use Replit. (Skip this part if you do)
  
  1. Open your web browser and go to the Replit website (https://replit.com/).
  2. If you already have a Replit account, click on the "Log In" button and enter your credentials. Otherwise, click on the "Sign Up" button and follow the instructions to create a new account.
  3. After logging in, you'll be redirected to your Replit dashboard. Click on the "New repl" button in the top right corner.
  4. In the pop-up window, select "C++" as the language for your repl. You can search for "C++" in the search bar or scroll down to find it.
  5. Give your repl a name by entering it in the "repl name" field. You can choose any name you like.
  6. Click the "Create Repl" button. Replit will now create a new repl for you with a default file named "main.cpp" that contains some basic code.
  7. On the left side of the Replit interface, you'll see the file explorer panel. It should already display the "main.cpp" file.
  8. To create a new .cpp file, right-click on the "main.cpp" file in the file explorer panel and select "New File" from the context menu.
  9. A new file will be created with a default name like "file1.cpp." You can rename it by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Rename" from the context menu. Enter the desired name for your .cpp file, including the   ".cpp" extension.
  10. To create a new .h file, follow the same steps as above but select "New File" from the context menu on the folder where you want to create the .h file (e.g., the main project folder).
  11. A new file will be created with a default name like "file2.h." Rename it by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Rename" from the context menu. Enter the desired name for your .h file, including the ".h" extension.
  12. Click on the newly created .cpp or .h file to open it in the code editor on the right side of the screen
  13. Now you can start writing your C++ code in the code editor. You can delete the existing code in the file or modify it as needed.
  14. Once you've written your code, you can click the "Run" button at the top of the screen to compile and execute your program.
 
Github To Replit 
  This part is just in case you do not know how to move the code from Github to Replit (Just a simple copy & paste)
  
  Open your web browser and go to the GitHub repository that contains the code you want to copy.
  
  1. In the GitHub repository, locate the file you want to copy (e.g., main.cpp, header.h, etc.). Click on the file to open it.
  2. Once the file is open, click on the "Raw" button at the top right corner of the code display. This will display the raw code without any formatting.
  3. Select all the code in the file by pressing "Ctrl + A" (Windows/Linux) or "Command + A" (Mac) to select all the code. Alternatively, you can manually highlight and select the entire code.
  4. Copy the selected code by pressing "Ctrl + C" (Windows/Linux) or "Command + C" (Mac).
  5. Now, go to your Replit project and navigate to the file where you want to paste the code. If you haven't created the necessary files yet, follow the previous instructions to create .cpp and .h files.
  6. Once you are in the desired file, paste the copied code by pressing "Ctrl + V" (Windows/Linux) or "Command + V" (Mac).
  7. Repeat the above steps for each file (.cpp, .h, etc.) that you want to copy from the GitHub repository. Create new files in Replit if needed.
  8. After copying all the necessary files, review the code to ensure everything copied correctly and that there are no missing or truncated sections.
  9. Once you're satisfied with the code, click the "Run" button at the top of the Replit interface to compile and execute your program.

OR!!!!!!! (again c:)

  If youre lazy like me I went ahead and pasted the link to my replit with all the files ready to use! Keep in mind in this assignment there is two replits, each on runs differently (you will see when it asks you to input a value)
  
  ***(I use Replit to code, so I hope it is not too much of an issue that I post the instructions on how to use it, I was once lost using it and now it's my Holy Grail)***
